# wHy YoU hErE???

seriously tho, wHaT aRe YoU dOiNg iN tHiS rEpO??? this is literally the most random collection of absolute nonsense you'll ever witness in your entire life. like fr fr no cap.

## wHaT eVeN iS tHiS???

honestly idk man. i made this at 3am and now it exists. that's the entire backstory. you're welcome.

some random stuff that might or might not be here:
- code that probably doesn't work
- files with weird names
- comments that make zero sense
- bugs that are actually features (trust me bro)
- vibes. just pure chaotic vibes.

## hOw To UsE???

```bash
# step 1: question your life choices
# step 2: there is no step 2
# step 3: ???
# step 4: profit (probably not)
```

bro just run it and see what happens lmaooo

## iNsTaLlAtIoN

idk just like... download it? clone it? print it out and eat it? your choice bestie 💀

## cOnTrIbUtInG

feel free to contribute literally anything. make it worse. make it better. make it weirder. i don't even care anymore. this repo is a free-for-all zone of pure chaos.

just remember: if it compiles, it ships. if it doesn't compile, it also ships. we don't discriminate here.

## wHy ThO???

because why not??? life is short. code is temporary. chaos is eternal.

also i was bored and this seemed funny at the time. still funny ngl.

yeah we're using WTFPL because this entire thing is a wtf moment. do WhatTheF*ck you want with this code. seriously. i don't care. sell it. frame it. use it as a pillow. whatever floats your boat.

## fInAl ThOuGhTs

if you actually read this entire readme, you deserve an award for wasting your time. congratulations. you played yourself.
